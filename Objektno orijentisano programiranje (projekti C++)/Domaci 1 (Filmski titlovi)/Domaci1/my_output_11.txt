1
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,820
I believe in America.

2
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,690
America has made my fortune

3
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,793
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:30,228
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,833
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:36,934
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,352
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:42,470
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:47,080
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:49,683
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,648
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:55,953
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:59,338
She resisted.

14
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:01,862
She kept her honor.

15
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,625
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:11,268
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,687
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:17,211
held together by wire.

19
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:21,809
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:28,146
But I wept. Why did I weep?

21
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:33,327
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,698
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,170
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:52,813
Sorry.

25
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:03,457
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:07,027
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,095
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,701
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:17,004
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:19,573
They went free that very day.

31
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,245
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:28,380
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:33,389
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,990
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:44,196
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,179
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:50,297
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,008
What is that?

39
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:20,401
That I cannot do.

40
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:23,404
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,573
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:32,011
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:35,050
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:37,651
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:42,385
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,737
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,261
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:51,393
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:54,001
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:57,605
I understand.

51
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,507
You found paradise in America.

52
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:05,291
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:08,011
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:10,618
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:16,016
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:18,626
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,230
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,893
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,502
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,417
Instead, you come into my house

61
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,419
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:35,943
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,340
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,179
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:46,853
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:51,425
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,475
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:13,380
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,745
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:19,832
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:22,356
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:24,570
And if, by chance,

73
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,639
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:29,163
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,767
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:40,341
Be my friend?

77
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,280
Godfather.

78
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:52,353
Good.

79
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:55,367
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,891
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:02,196
But until that day...

82
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,458
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:10,437
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego</i>

84
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,980
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,896
I want reliable people,

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,098
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,633
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,217
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,196
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,964
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:00,199
We're not taking it.

92
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:02,723
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:05,224
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,598
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:04,117
Don Barzini.

96
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,618
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,964
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,632
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:26,986
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,821
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,345
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:34,848
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,370
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:47,354
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,797
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,321
In small bills, cash.

107
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,157
In that little silk purse.

108
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:20,093
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

109
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:23,561
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...</i>

110
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,511
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:28,035
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,745
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,704
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:54,039
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:56,964
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,317
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,841
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:13,692
Get outta here.

119
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,216
This is a private party. Go on.

120
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:19,653
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,229
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:35,200
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:39,072
There.

124
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:52,064
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,716
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,324
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,072
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,596
Now that the war is over...

129
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:05,725
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,396
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:12,005
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,987
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,511
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,081
You understand everything.

135
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,284
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,834
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,269
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,853
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,195
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:46,500
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,143
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:58,463
Hey, Michael. How are you?

143
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,987
Hello.

144
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:20,403
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,161
Is this... Is this necessary?

146
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:31,096
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,165
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,866
All right.

149
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,121
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,727
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,330
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,233
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:48,860
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:50,515
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,039
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:56,443
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,257
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:00,592
Who is he? What's his name?

159
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:03,210
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,819
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:09,095
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,096
Mike!

163
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,597
Ho! Tom.

164
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:13,121
Heyyy!

165
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:16,174
You look terrific!

166
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:18,377
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,926
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:23,382
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:25,126
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,650
I'll be there.

171
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,706
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,792
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,316
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:39,719
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,789
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:45,992
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,774
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:51,109
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,633
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:55,881
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:58,405
Very important to the family.

182
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,474
You like your lasagne?

183
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:10,385
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:13,717
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,828
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,598
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,201
be a masculine child.

188
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:34,066
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,923
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:40,939
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,508
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,665
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,189
Thank you.

194
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:55,679
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,284
but said you'd understand.

196
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:01,121
Also some of the judges.

197
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:04,124
They've all sent gifts.

198
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,461
What is that outside?

199
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:19,100
Johnny!

200
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:24,544
I love you.

201
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,247
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:36,085
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:36,191 --> 00:18:38,431
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:40,955
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:47,534
Sing a song.

206
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:04,584
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:08,646
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:10,802
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:13,920
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,774
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,732
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,344
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:23,065
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:29,007
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,611
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,349
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:42,049
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:48,224
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,595
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,713
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:00,485
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,376
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,979
with a big bandleader.

225
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,460
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:10,984
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:14,383
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,990
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,426
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:24,397
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,860
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,470
only this time with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,201
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,974
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,827
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:45,376
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,322
What was that?

238
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,154
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:54,506
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,030
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:05,104
That's a true story.

242
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,984
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,333
Beautiful!

244
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:43,621
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,145
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,367
I'll take care of it.

247
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:11,838
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,382
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:25,518
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:29,122
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,090
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,696
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:42,097
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:44,516
It's weak.

255
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,168
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,904
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,513
But this, uh...

258
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:55,760
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:57,829
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:00,447
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:04,117
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,630
Sonny?

263
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:12,331
Sonny?

264
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:19,873
Sonny?

265
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,602
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:25,344
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:29,315
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:46,057
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:47,979
A best-seller.

270
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:50,281
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,805
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:54,285
Just be myself.

273
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,177
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:02,517
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,330
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:07,982
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,970
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,538
What is that nonsense?

279
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:16,062
Ridiculous!

280
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:23,334
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:24,983
Good.

282
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,247
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:29,420
can never be a real man.

284
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:31,944
Come here.

285
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,917
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,132
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:44,284
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:46,893
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:50,163
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,647
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,265
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:02,369
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:05,812
All right.

294
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:31,801
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,385
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,606
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:40,058
Never. Give him a living...

298
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:43,108
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,595
What else?

300
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,197
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,599
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:51,123
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,471
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:55,573
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,395
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,000
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:04,938
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,810
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,258
Wait a minute.

310
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,782
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:20,999
Just a little closer.

312
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,523
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:10,863
Isn't that nice?

314
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:17,548
All right, start talking.

315
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:20,072
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:23,538
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:27,376
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:29,961
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:33,079
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,753
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,742
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,644
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,479
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:50,615
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:52,617
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:52,641 --> 00:28:54,619
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:57,021
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:59,707
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,425
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,928
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,297
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,565
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,183
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,193
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,273
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:18,198
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,531
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:24,136
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,040
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,481
Check him out.

341
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,805
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:02,086
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,388
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:07,040
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:09,393
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,462
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:13,965
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,566
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,670
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,194
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,991
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:28,412
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:30,748
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:33,272
Khartoum.

355
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:40,103
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,759
Beautiful.

357
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:43,427
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,951
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,922
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:53,237
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:55,239
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:56,374
I respect that.

363
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,898
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,500
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:04,303
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:07,364
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:09,975
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:15,076
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:17,161
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,685
And let me tell you why.

371
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:24,051
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,137
most valuable protégés.

373
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:28,472
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:31,556
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,045
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,347
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:39,101
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:41,585
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,134
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,045
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,258
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,261
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,785
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:55,633
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:58,558
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:02,361
And she runs off.

387
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:05,723
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:09,347
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:12,135
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,618
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,754
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:19,278
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:23,176
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:26,785
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:32:28,223 --> 00:32:30,817
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:34,725
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:31,372
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:33,979
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,116
Now...

400
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,419
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,434
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,236
<i>but only
in matters of business...</i>

403
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,760
<i>with some sort
of reasonable complaint.</i>

404
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,090
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,532
<i>He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...</i>

406
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,537
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

407
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:02,207
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...</i>

408
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,388
<i>for which he gives
a piece of the action.</i>

409
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:06,390
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:09,212
<i>The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.</i>

411
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,462
<i>Now, they have to be
in it for something.</i>

412
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,596
Santino Corleone.

413
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,465
What about his prison record?

414
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,989
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:20,037
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,561
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:26,165
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:28,779
Tom?

419
00:35:28,803 --> 00:35:31,303
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...</i>

420
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:33,350
<i>than anything else
we're looking at.</i>

421
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,786
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,
somebody else will.</i>

422
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,922
<i>Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.</i>

423
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,226
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,480
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,762
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:47,550
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,934
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,435
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,270
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:54,772
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:54,796 --> 00:35:57,296
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:03,929
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,180
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

434
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:18,780
I need a million dollars in cash.

435
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,965
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

436
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:24,652
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

437
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,339
What is the interest
for my family?

438
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,274
Thirty percent.

439
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:33,096
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

440
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,902
And then it would go up.

441
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:40,005
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

442
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:45,511
My compliments.

443
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:50,944
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

444
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:54,649
So, I receive 30% for finance...

445
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,235
political influence
and legal protection.

446
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,759
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

447
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:06,566
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

448
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:09,603
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

449
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:11,881
just "finance"...

450
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:13,905
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

451
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:27,687
I said that I would see you because...

452
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,967
I heard that you were
a serious man...

453
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,491
to be treated with respect.

454
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:40,328
But I must say no to you.

455
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:43,947
And I'll give you my reason.

456
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,769
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

457
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,421
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

458
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:52,790
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

459
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:56,011
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

460
00:37:56,117 --> 00:37:58,745
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

461
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:00,831
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

462
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:03,619
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

463
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:06,225
but your business is...

464
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:09,006
a little dangerous.

465
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,508
If you're worried about security
for your million...

466
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:13,210
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

467
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,964
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

468
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,570
Wait a minute.

469
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,623
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

470
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,959
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

471
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:30,661
They talk when they should listen.

472
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,796
But anyway...

473
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,320
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

474
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:38,187
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

475
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:41,557
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

476
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:44,631
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

477
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:48,567
Thank you.

478
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,523
Come here.

479
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:15,105
What's the matter with you?

480
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:16,907
I think your brain
is going soft...

481
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,798
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

482
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,302
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

483
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,973
Go on.

484
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,441
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

485
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:36,048
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

486
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,564
Well, take it away.

487
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:43,088
Take it over there.

488
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:45,803
And...

489
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:48,327
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

490
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:57,331
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

491
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:00,805
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

492
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,687
Go to the Tattaglias...

493
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:06,023
and make them think...

494
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:09,744
that you're not too happy
with our family...

495
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:13,352
and find out what you can.

496
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:34,130
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

497
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:36,286
and a tie for Freddy...

498
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,006
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

499
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:41,191
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

500
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,715
Oh, just you.

501
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,028
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

502
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:19,463
Okay, Pa.

503
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,388
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

504
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:27,893
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

505
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:20,402
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

506
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:21,959
I know.

507
00:42:21,983 --> 00:42:24,483
Scotch? Prewar.

508
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:32,158
You know who I am?

509
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,590
I know you.

510
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,470
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

511
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,470
I think you and I can do business.

512
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,980
I need someone strong like you.

513
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,440
I heard you are not happy...

514
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,150
...with the Corleone family.

515
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,650
Want to join me?

516
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,780
What's in it for me?

517
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,330
$50,000 to start with.

518
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,580
Not bad!

519
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,880
Agreed?

520
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:13,270
Oh. Tom Hagen.

521
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:15,072
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

522
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:18,031
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

523
00:44:18,132 --> 00:44:20,010
I haven't got time.

524
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,798
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

525
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:26,483
What are you worried about?

526
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:29,007
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

527
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,310
Get in.

528
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:44,291
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

529
00:44:44,492 --> 00:44:46,992
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

530
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,010
Hi. Merry Christmas.

531
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:56,534
I want some fruit over there.

532
00:44:59,273 --> 00:45:01,773
Gimme three of them.

533
00:45:02,877 --> 00:45:05,377
No, that one.

534
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:25,997
Fredo!

535
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:15,146
Papa.

536
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:17,682
Papa!

537
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:25,287
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

538
00:46:25,392 --> 00:46:27,892
like in the story, you know?

539
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:31,131
No.

540
00:46:31,232 --> 00:46:34,133
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

541
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:36,735
Now that's a thought.

542
00:46:38,106 --> 00:46:39,106
Michael.

543
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:43,038
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

544
00:46:43,143 --> 00:46:45,643
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

545
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:03,928
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

546
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,025
Sonny, Michael.

547
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:29,449
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

548
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,201
Is he all right?

549
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:33,955
<i>We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.</i>

550
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:37,996
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

551
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:41,560
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

552
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:44,080
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

553
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:46,249
Didn't Tom tell you? I called.

554
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:50,004
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

555
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,610
All right.

556
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,819
Oh, my God.

557
00:48:14,802 --> 00:48:17,302
Who is it?

558
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:19,904
Open up. It's Clemenza.

559
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:21,951
What?

560
00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:24,475
There's more news about your old man.

561
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,990
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

562
00:48:27,014 --> 00:48:28,992
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

563
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:31,516
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

564
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:33,730
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

565
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:36,274
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

566
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:37,867
Only maybe three, four times.

567
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:40,131
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

568
00:48:40,155 --> 00:48:41,671
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

569
00:48:41,695 --> 00:48:43,506
I don't care how sick he is.

570
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,276
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him
to my father's house now. You understand? Now

571
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,098
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

572
00:48:49,203 --> 00:48:51,703
All right.

573
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:01,913
I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

574
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,764
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

575
00:49:07,788 --> 00:49:10,288
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

576
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:14,394
<i>In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.</i>

577
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,862
<i>Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.</i>

578
00:49:17,965 --> 00:49:19,576
<i>What's done is done.</i>

579
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,569
<i>And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?</i>

580
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,169
No, I'll wait.

581
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,185
Your boss is dead.

582
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:45,969
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

583
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:48,493
so I don't want you to be scared.

584
00:49:49,062 --> 00:49:51,587
I want you
to help the Corleones...

585
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,198
and I want you to help me.

586
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,581
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

587
00:49:58,605 --> 00:50:01,105
just about an hour after we picked you up.

588
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:05,443
Drink it.

589
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:12,018
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

590
00:50:16,557 --> 00:50:19,057
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

591
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:22,961
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

592
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:27,298
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

593
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,568
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

594
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:33,716
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

595
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,971
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

596
00:50:37,945 --> 00:50:40,226
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

597
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,750
that will prevent a full-scale war.

598
00:50:43,183 --> 00:50:45,528
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

599
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:48,112
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

600
00:50:51,024 --> 00:50:53,524
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

601
00:50:57,998 --> 00:50:59,542
Well, now he's dead.

602
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:02,066
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

603
00:51:03,704 --> 00:51:05,815
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

604
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,750
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

605
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:10,274
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

606
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:17,181
It's good business, Tom.

607
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,396
I'll try.

608
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,082
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

609
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:28,593
Yeah. Well...

610
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:31,896
Let me worry about Luca.

611
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:39,182
You just talk to Sonny.

612
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:41,706
And the other two kids.

613
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:46,422
I'll do my best.

614
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:48,946
Good.

615
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,250
Now, you can go.

616
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:02,459
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

617
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:06,497
Blood is a big expense.

618
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:29,465
He's still alive.

619
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:31,989
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

620
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:35,471
Well, that's bad luck for me...

621
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:37,995
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

622
00:53:22,976 --> 00:53:25,021
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

623
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:27,545
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

624
00:53:29,616 --> 00:53:31,861
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

625
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:34,752
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

626
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:37,517
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

627
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:40,264
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

628
00:53:40,288 --> 00:53:42,405
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

629
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,023
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

630
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:50,499
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

631
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:52,649
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

632
00:53:52,673 --> 00:53:54,751
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

633
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:55,818
Hey, Mick, try him again.

634
00:53:55,842 --> 00:53:57,487
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

635
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:00,011
He always goes home
when he's through.

636
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:03,516
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

637
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:06,745
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

638
00:54:06,853 --> 00:54:09,353
If we lose the old man...

639
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:13,058
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

640
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,061
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

641
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:18,508
just to avoid a long destructive war.

642
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:22,263
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

643
00:54:23,503 --> 00:54:26,003
If your father dies...

644
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,085
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

645
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:31,669
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

646
00:54:31,778 --> 00:54:34,278
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

647
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:41,197
What is it?

648
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:43,666
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

649
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,318
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

650
00:54:46,426 --> 00:54:48,926
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

651
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:54,277
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

652
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:55,778
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

653
00:54:55,802 --> 00:54:58,498
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

654
00:54:58,605 --> 00:55:00,650
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

655
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:02,594
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

656
00:55:02,618 --> 00:55:05,118
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

657
00:55:06,646 --> 00:55:09,146
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

658
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:11,707
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

659
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:14,912
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

660
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,332
Understood.

661
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,668
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

662
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:21,453
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

663
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,955
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

664
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:27,310
Yeah.

665
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:30,861
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

666
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:34,472
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

667
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:45,649
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

668
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:48,252
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

669
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:04,535
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

670
00:56:04,571 --> 00:56:07,071
I don't know. Probably late.

671
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:11,868
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:18,381
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

673
00:56:20,554 --> 00:56:22,098
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

674
00:56:22,122 --> 00:56:24,167
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

675
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,751
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

676
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,954
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

677
00:56:30,063 --> 00:56:32,408
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

678
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:35,312
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

679
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:37,280
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

680
00:56:37,304 --> 00:56:39,804
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

681
00:56:50,183 --> 00:56:52,595
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

682
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:55,679
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

683
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,690
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean because...

684
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:01,989
Those guys are gonna be stuck up in there for a long time, you know?

685
00:57:02,095 --> 00:57:04,273
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

686
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:06,375
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

687
00:57:06,399 --> 00:57:09,368
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

688
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:11,969
<i>- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?</i>

689
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:15,673
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

690
00:57:15,742 --> 00:57:17,787
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

691
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:20,311
I gotta take a leak.

692
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:03,299
Leave the gun.

693
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:05,823
Take the cannoli.

694
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:24,112
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

695
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:26,113
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

696
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:28,614
Yeah?

697
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,114
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

698
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:38,322
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

699
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:43,572
Hello, Kay?

700
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:44,941
<i>How's your father?</i>

701
00:58:44,965 --> 00:58:46,742
He's good. He's gonna make it.

702
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:49,243
<i>I love you.</i>

703
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:50,267
Huh?

704
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,570
<i>I love you!</i>

705
00:58:52,806 --> 00:58:54,307
<i>Michael?</i>

706
00:58:54,685 --> 00:58:55,685
Yeah, I know.

707
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:57,486
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

708
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,187
Yeah, I can't talk.

709
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:01,011
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

710
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:04,315
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

711
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:07,509
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

712
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,665
I love you with all o' my heart!

713
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:12,214
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

714
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,438
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

715
00:59:15,462 --> 00:59:17,962
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

716
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:20,776
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

717
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,345
Then you fry some garlic.

718
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:24,997
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

719
00:59:25,105 --> 00:59:27,767
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

720
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:31,037
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

721
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:36,413
Add a little bit of wine.

722
00:59:39,252 --> 00:59:42,153
And a little bit of sugar.

723
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,900
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

724
00:59:44,924 --> 00:59:47,069
I got more important things
for you to do.

725
00:59:47,093 --> 00:59:49,687
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

726
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:54,243
- Where you going?
- To the city.

727
00:59:54,267 --> 00:59:55,911
Send some bodyguards with him.

728
00:59:55,935 --> 00:59:57,913
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

729
00:59:57,937 --> 01:00:00,838
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

730
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,440
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

731
01:00:06,446 --> 01:00:08,946
Send somebody with him anyway.

732
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:38,954
I have to go.

733
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:41,478
Can I go with you?

734
01:00:41,815 --> 01:00:44,375
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

735
01:00:44,484 --> 01:00:46,462
People from the press.

736
01:00:46,486 --> 01:00:48,986
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

737
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,490
I don't want you to get involved.

738
01:00:56,162 --> 01:00:58,662
When will I see you again?

739
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:06,816
Go back to New Hampshire...

740
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,340
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

741
01:01:10,677 --> 01:01:13,177
When will I see you again,
Michael?

742
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:17,181
I don't know.

743
01:03:27,213 --> 01:03:29,325
What are you doing here?

744
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:31,427
You're not supposed
to be here now.

745
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:35,012
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

746
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:37,681
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

747
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:40,102
Your father just had
too many visitors.

748
01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:43,027
They interfered
with hospital service.

749
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:46,030
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

750
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:54,872
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

751
01:03:57,477 --> 01:03:59,977
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

752
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:06,128
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

753
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:08,712
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

754
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:11,813
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

755
01:04:11,924 --> 01:04:14,722
<i>- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.</i>

756
01:04:14,827 --> 01:04:17,139
I won't panic.

757
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:19,723
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

758
01:04:22,669 --> 01:04:25,399
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

759
01:04:25,505 --> 01:04:28,565
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

760
01:04:28,675 --> 01:04:32,167
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

761
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:34,456
Men are coming here to kill him.

762
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,592
You understand?

763
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:39,116
Now, help me, please.

764
01:05:55,461 --> 01:06:00,194
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

765
01:06:00,299 --> 01:06:01,777
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

766
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:03,681
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

767
01:06:03,705 --> 01:06:05,614
There's gonna be trouble.

768
01:06:05,638 --> 01:06:08,117
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

769
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,641
For your father. For your father.

770
01:06:11,644 --> 01:06:13,455
All right, listen.

771
01:06:13,479 --> 01:06:15,624
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

772
01:06:15,648 --> 01:06:18,651
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

773
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:20,075
Okay, okay.

774
01:06:32,598 --> 01:06:36,898
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

775
01:06:38,104 --> 01:06:40,604
I'm with you now.

776
01:06:41,774 --> 01:06:44,274
I'm with you.

777
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:21,311
Get rid of these. Come here.

778
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:24,147
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

779
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:27,317
You'll be all right.

780
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:34,091
You'll be okay.

781
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:20,303
You did good.

782
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,584
Here he is.

783
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:58,108
All right, hold still.

784
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:09,965
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

785
01:09:09,989 --> 01:09:11,433
What the hell are you doing here?

786
01:09:11,457 --> 01:09:13,957
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

787
01:09:14,293 --> 01:09:15,938
Why, you little punk.

788
01:09:15,962 --> 01:09:18,002
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

789
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:19,841
I pulled them guys off of here.

790
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:22,857
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

791
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:25,938
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

792
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:28,617
Phil, take him in.

793
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:31,053
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

794
01:09:31,077 --> 01:09:33,978
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

795
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:38,607
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

796
01:09:39,919 --> 01:09:42,030
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

797
01:09:42,054 --> 01:09:44,554
Stand him up straight.

798
01:10:06,445 --> 01:10:08,490
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

799
01:10:08,514 --> 01:10:11,244
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

800
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:13,862
They're licensed to carry firearms.

801
01:10:13,886 --> 01:10:16,386
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

802
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:19,015
in the morning and show cause.

803
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:21,625
All right, let him go.

804
01:10:21,694 --> 01:10:24,194
Come on.

805
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:55,637
What's with all the new faces?

806
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:57,472
Gonna need 'em now.

807
01:10:57,496 --> 01:11:00,124
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

808
01:11:00,232 --> 01:11:03,360
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

809
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,170
Jesus Christ.

810
01:11:13,512 --> 01:11:16,012
Looks like a fortress around here.

811
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:23,420
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

812
01:11:23,522 --> 01:11:26,753
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

813
01:11:29,361 --> 01:11:31,861
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

814
01:11:35,301 --> 01:11:36,978
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

815
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:38,480
You're gorgeous.

816
01:11:38,504 --> 01:11:41,200
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

817
01:11:41,307 --> 01:11:44,037
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

818
01:11:44,143 --> 01:11:46,455
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

819
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:48,979
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

820
01:11:49,648 --> 01:11:51,793
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

821
01:11:51,817 --> 01:11:54,877
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

822
01:11:55,488 --> 01:11:57,132
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

823
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:58,800
That's part of the deal.

824
01:11:58,824 --> 01:12:00,802
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

825
01:12:00,826 --> 01:12:03,326
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

826
01:12:03,663 --> 01:12:06,141
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

827
01:12:06,165 --> 01:12:09,726
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

828
01:12:09,835 --> 01:12:11,646
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

829
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,315
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

830
01:12:13,339 --> 01:12:15,419
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

831
01:12:15,443 --> 01:12:17,923
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

832
01:12:17,947 --> 01:12:20,236
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

833
01:12:20,346 --> 01:12:23,747
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

834
01:12:23,849 --> 01:12:25,849
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

835
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:27,496
And do me a favor, Tom...

836
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,498
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

837
01:12:29,522 --> 01:12:32,022
Just help me win, please.
All right?

838
01:12:37,963 --> 01:12:40,523
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

839
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:42,110
What about him?

840
01:12:42,134 --> 01:12:45,194
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

841
01:12:45,304 --> 01:12:48,205
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

842
01:12:48,307 --> 01:12:50,285
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

843
01:12:50,309 --> 01:12:52,454
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

844
01:12:52,478 --> 01:12:54,289
he is invulnerable.

845
01:12:54,313 --> 01:12:57,874
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

846
01:12:57,983 --> 01:13:01,043
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

847
01:13:01,153 --> 01:13:03,883
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

848
01:13:03,989 --> 01:13:07,686
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

849
01:13:09,161 --> 01:13:11,306
So do me a favor.

850
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:13,958
Take this into consideration.

851
01:13:16,769 --> 01:13:19,269
All right, we'll wait.

852
01:13:24,009 --> 01:13:26,488
We can't wait.

853
01:13:26,512 --> 01:13:28,490
Can't wait.

854
01:13:28,514 --> 01:13:30,274
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

855
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:32,427
He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

856
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:34,262
That's the key for him.

857
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:36,264
Got to get Sollozzo.

858
01:13:36,288 --> 01:13:38,433
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

859
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,435
Let me ask you something first.

860
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:43,519
What about this McCluskey?

861
01:13:43,629 --> 01:13:46,129
What do we do with this cop here?

862
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,969
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

863
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:57,033
It will be me...

864
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:59,642
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

865
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:03,146
Let's set the meeting.

866
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:08,218
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

867
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:14,053
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

868
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,890
Some place where there's people,
so I feel safe.

869
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:23,734
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

870
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:26,336
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

871
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:32,008
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

872
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:34,611
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

873
01:14:39,451 --> 01:14:41,951
then I'll kill them both.

874
01:14:53,832 --> 01:14:56,357
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

875
01:14:56,446 --> 01:14:58,446
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

876
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,448
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

877
01:15:00,472 --> 01:15:02,489
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

878
01:15:02,513 --> 01:15:04,825
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

879
01:15:04,849 --> 01:15:06,454
You gotta get up close,
like this and...

880
01:15:06,478 --> 01:15:09,879
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

881
01:15:09,982 --> 01:15:12,294
You're taking this very personal.

882
01:15:12,318 --> 01:15:15,549
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

883
01:15:15,654 --> 01:15:17,666
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

884
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:20,215
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

885
01:15:20,326 --> 01:15:23,056
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

886
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:27,292
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

887
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:30,266
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

888
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:32,414
That's a terrific story.

889
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:35,168
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

890
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:38,920
They might like a story like that.

891
01:15:38,944 --> 01:15:41,444
They might. They just might.

892
01:15:44,283 --> 01:15:46,428
It's not personal, Sonny.

893
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:48,952
It's strictly business.

894
01:15:50,956 --> 01:15:52,600
It's as cold as they come.

895
01:15:52,624 --> 01:15:56,185
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

896
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:59,196
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

897
01:15:59,298 --> 01:16:01,798
Here. Try it.

898
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:14,978
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

899
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,295
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

900
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:25,052
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

901
01:16:25,157 --> 01:16:27,657
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

902
01:16:30,262 --> 01:16:32,407
Sit down, finish my dinner.

903
01:16:32,431 --> 01:16:34,075
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

904
01:16:34,099 --> 01:16:37,660
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

905
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:39,914
Everybody will still think
you got it.

906
01:16:39,938 --> 01:16:42,083
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

907
01:16:42,107 --> 01:16:45,167
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

908
01:16:45,277 --> 01:16:48,678
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

909
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:50,981
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

910
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:53,505
so don't worry about nothing.

911
01:16:54,453 --> 01:16:56,264
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

912
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:58,600
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

913
01:16:58,624 --> 01:17:01,102
and we're gonna catch the hell.

914
01:17:01,126 --> 01:17:03,271
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

915
01:17:03,295 --> 01:17:05,273
Pretty goddamn bad.

916
01:17:05,297 --> 01:17:08,357
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

917
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:11,368
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

918
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:14,030
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

919
01:17:14,139 --> 01:17:16,699
Been ten years since
the last one.

920
01:17:16,809 --> 01:17:18,787
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

921
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:20,955
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

922
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:22,957
They should have never let him
get away with that.

923
01:17:22,981 --> 01:17:25,481
They was just asking
for big trouble.

924
01:17:25,818 --> 01:17:28,378
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

925
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:30,231
being a hero and all.

926
01:17:30,255 --> 01:17:32,755
Your father too.

927
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:11,940
Nothing. Not a hint.

928
01:18:11,964 --> 01:18:14,464
Absolutely nothing.

929
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:17,534
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's going to be held.

930
01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:21,304
How much time do we have?

931
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:24,221
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

932
01:18:24,245 --> 01:18:26,745
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

933
01:18:28,147 --> 01:18:30,647
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

934
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:33,980
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

935
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,597
What about the negotiator?

936
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:38,317
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

937
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:40,201
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

938
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:43,854
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

939
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:47,523
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

940
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:49,911
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

941
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:51,913
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

942
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:54,437
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

943
01:18:55,107 --> 01:18:57,607
I get it.

944
01:19:06,952 --> 01:19:09,452
Yeah.

945
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,201
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

946
01:19:25,304 --> 01:19:27,115
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

947
01:19:27,139 --> 01:19:29,972
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

948
01:19:30,075 --> 01:19:32,976
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

949
01:19:33,078 --> 01:19:34,622
Anybody know this joint?

950
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:38,047
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

951
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,395
A small family place, good food.

952
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:43,252
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

953
01:19:43,355 --> 01:19:46,153
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

954
01:19:46,258 --> 01:19:49,489
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

955
01:19:51,096 --> 01:19:53,656
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

956
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:55,243
All right.

957
01:19:55,267 --> 01:19:58,430
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

958
01:19:58,537 --> 01:20:00,915
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

959
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:02,617
You make them relax.

960
01:20:02,641 --> 01:20:04,986
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

961
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:07,672
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

962
01:20:07,779 --> 01:20:09,624
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

963
01:20:09,648 --> 01:20:12,583
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

964
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:14,762
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

965
01:20:14,786 --> 01:20:16,764
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

966
01:20:16,788 --> 01:20:20,468
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, all right?

967
01:20:20,492 --> 01:20:21,603
The gun will be there.

968
01:20:21,627 --> 01:20:25,859
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

969
01:20:25,964 --> 01:20:28,464
Come on. Let's move.

970
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:31,033
Thank you, Tom.

971
01:20:33,305 --> 01:20:36,206
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

972
01:20:36,308 --> 01:20:38,808
Yeah, a million times.

973
01:20:42,981 --> 01:20:45,460
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

974
01:20:45,484 --> 01:20:47,629
as soon as you
come out the door.

975
01:20:47,653 --> 01:20:50,153
Let's go.

976
01:20:53,659 --> 01:20:56,389
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

977
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,475
At least a year, Mike.

978
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:04,060
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

979
01:21:04,169 --> 01:21:08,572
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

980
01:21:08,674 --> 01:21:11,174
when I think the time is right.

981
01:21:16,348 --> 01:21:18,848
Take care.

982
01:21:21,019 --> 01:21:23,519
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

983
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,298
I'm glad you came, Mike.

984
01:21:57,322 --> 01:21:59,822
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

985
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:03,359
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

986
01:22:03,462 --> 01:22:05,306
It should have never happened.

987
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,475
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

988
01:22:07,499 --> 01:22:09,977
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

989
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:14,062
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

990
01:22:14,172 --> 01:22:17,403
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

991
01:22:17,509 --> 01:22:19,987
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

992
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:22,511
You can't talk business
with him.

993
01:22:23,682 --> 01:22:26,182
He's a good kid.

994
01:22:29,521 --> 01:22:32,021
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

995
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,603
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

996
01:22:35,627 --> 01:22:38,127
On your knees, facing me.

997
01:22:41,967 --> 01:22:44,868
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

998
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:48,015
Too grouchy.

999
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:50,701
Can't stand the aggravation.

1000
01:22:50,809 --> 01:22:53,309
You know how it is.

1001
01:22:54,146 --> 01:22:56,646
He's clean.

1002
01:23:22,507 --> 01:23:25,007
We're going to Jersey?

1003
01:23:26,678 --> 01:23:29,178
Maybe.

1004
01:23:53,805 --> 01:23:56,305
Nice work, Lou.

1005
01:24:32,978 --> 01:24:35,022
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

1006
01:24:35,046 --> 01:24:37,458
Good. Try the veal.

1007
01:24:37,482 --> 01:24:39,982
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

1008
01:24:41,483 --> 01:24:43,483
<i>Understand?</i>

1009
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:17,832
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

1010
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:20,356
Go ahead.

1011
01:25:25,256 --> 01:25:27,756
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

1012
01:25:30,757 --> 01:25:36,757
What happened to
your father was business.

1013
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:41,735
I have much respect for your father...

1014
01:25:41,759 --> 01:25:45,759
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

1015
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,760
You must understand why
I did what I did.

1016
01:25:51,761 --> 01:25:54,761
I understand these things.

1017
01:25:55,262 --> 01:25:56,939
I do.

1018
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:59,463
You do.

1019
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,964
Now we have to think about what happens

1020
01:26:14,265 --> 01:26:18,165
between you and the Tattaglias.

1021
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:22,942
We have to work through

1022
01:26:22,966 --> 01:26:26,966
where we go from here.

1023
01:26:34,466 --> 01:26:36,966
How do I say...?

1024
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:41,270
What I want...

1025
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,939
what's most important to me...

1026
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:48,422
is that I have a guarantee:

1027
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:50,591
No more attempts
on my father's life.

1028
01:26:50,615 --> 01:26:54,847
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?
I am the hunted one.

1029
01:26:55,453 --> 01:26:58,513
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

1030
01:26:58,623 --> 01:27:01,123
I'm not that clever.

1031
01:27:02,293 --> 01:27:04,793
All I want is a truce.

1032
01:27:11,302 --> 01:27:14,999
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

1033
01:27:16,307 --> 01:27:18,807
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1034
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:26,060
I frisked him. He's clean.

1035
01:27:26,084 --> 01:27:28,584
Don't take too long.

1036
01:27:31,756 --> 01:27:34,256
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

1037
01:28:49,554 --> 01:28:52,054
Everything all right?

1038
01:28:53,055 --> 01:28:55,532
I respect myself... understand?

1039
01:28:55,556 --> 01:28:58,556
And so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

1040
01:28:59,357 --> 01:29:02,357
What happened was unavoidable.

1041
01:29:03,358 --> 01:29:05,835
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

1042
01:29:05,859 --> 01:29:08,336
If your father were in better health...

1043
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,860
without his eldest son running things...

1044
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:26,166
Hey, come on.

1045
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,690
Come on. Let's go.

1046
01:32:24,349 --> 01:32:26,849
Joe, you take over.

1047
01:32:29,687 --> 01:32:32,187
Hi, Grandpa.

1048
01:32:43,634 --> 01:32:46,134
I love you, Grandpa.

1049
01:32:48,139 --> 01:32:50,869
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

1050
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:55,456
- Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1051
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,624
"I hope you get red, Grandpa...

1052
01:32:57,648 --> 01:32:59,626
and I wish I would see you soon.

1053
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:02,150
Love, your grandson, Frank."

1054
01:33:04,655 --> 01:33:06,967
Go with your mother.

1055
01:33:06,991 --> 01:33:09,491
Go ahead. Take 'em downstairs.

1056
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:17,666
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1057
01:33:19,003 --> 01:33:21,503
Go on.

1058
01:33:24,008 --> 01:33:27,239
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1059
01:33:27,345 --> 01:33:29,223
- That's enough bread.
- I like bread.

1060
01:33:29,247 --> 01:33:31,747
I know, but how much can you eat?

1061
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:43,270
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1062
01:33:43,294 --> 01:33:45,794
Shut up and set the table.

1063
01:34:00,978 --> 01:34:03,538
Since McCluskey's killing...

1064
01:34:03,648 --> 01:34:07,049
the police have been cracking down
most of our operations.

1065
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:11,320
And also the other families'.

1066
01:34:11,823 --> 01:34:13,600
Been a lot of bad blood.

1067
01:34:13,624 --> 01:34:17,116
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1068
01:34:17,995 --> 01:34:20,140
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

1069
01:34:20,164 --> 01:34:22,476
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1070
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,901
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1071
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:29,671
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

1072
01:34:30,274 --> 01:34:35,007
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

1073
01:34:35,113 --> 01:34:37,707
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

1074
01:34:37,815 --> 01:34:39,760
I want him to rest.

1075
01:34:39,784 --> 01:34:42,262
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

1076
01:34:42,286 --> 01:34:44,786
Yeah.

1077
01:34:50,461 --> 01:34:52,961
Where is Michael?

1078
01:35:04,809 --> 01:35:07,403
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1079
01:35:09,814 --> 01:35:13,545
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1080
01:35:35,273 --> 01:35:37,873
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1081
01:35:37,897 --> 01:35:39,419
I want his ass now... right now.

1082
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,255
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1083
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:43,090
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

1084
01:35:43,114 --> 01:35:45,844
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1085
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,928
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

1086
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:50,430
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide what...

1087
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,494
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1088
01:35:52,518 --> 01:35:54,268
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

1089
01:35:54,292 --> 01:35:57,022
Well neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

1090
01:35:57,128 --> 01:35:59,106
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.

1091
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:01,108
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

1092
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:03,277
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1093
01:36:03,301 --> 01:36:04,945
Well you just do what I tell you to do!

1094
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:07,129
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere, a Sicilian,

1095
01:36:07,153 --> 01:36:09,116
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1096
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,640
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1097
01:36:14,979 --> 01:36:17,479
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1098
01:36:18,482 --> 01:36:21,508
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

1099
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:25,216
Them niggers are having
a good time...

1100
01:36:25,323 --> 01:36:26,967
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

1101
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:30,825
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1102
01:36:30,928 --> 01:36:34,329
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1103
01:36:34,432 --> 01:36:37,993
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1104
01:36:38,102 --> 01:36:40,832
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1105
01:36:40,938 --> 01:36:43,998
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1106
01:36:45,943 --> 01:36:48,543
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1107
01:36:48,613 --> 01:36:50,591
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1108
01:36:50,615 --> 01:36:53,115
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1109
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,730
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

1110
01:37:46,037 --> 01:37:47,537
Michael

1111
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,280
Why are you so far
from the house?

1112
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:53,610
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

1113
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:54,990
The bodyguards are here.

1114
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:57,240
It's still dangerous...

1115
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:00,120
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

1116
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,790
Your enemies know you're here.

1117
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:07,540
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

1118
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:09,500
Not yet.

1119
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:12,010
It's out of the question.

1120
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:16,890
Where are you going now?

1121
01:38:17,526 --> 01:38:18,526
Corleone.

1122
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:19,600
To Corleone.

1123
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,470
Take my car.

1124
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:25,850
I want to walk.

1125
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,650
Be careful.

1126
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:52,039
Look there. Corleone.

1127
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,560
Where have all the men gone?

1128
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,810
They're all dead from vendettas.

1129
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,860
There are the names of the dead.

1130
01:39:29,376 --> 01:39:32,709
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1131
01:39:33,276 --> 01:39:34,276
Hey, hey, hey!

1132
01:39:34,315 --> 01:39:37,375
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1133
01:39:37,876 --> 01:39:39,353
America! America!

1134
01:39:39,377 --> 01:39:40,854
Take me to the America, G.I.

1135
01:39:40,878 --> 01:39:42,878
Clark Gable. Rita Hayworth.

1136
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:03,120
Mamma mia what a beauty.

1137
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:14,380
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

1138
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:24,600
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

1139
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:38,196
Hey, host.

1140
01:40:39,897 --> 01:40:41,897
A bottle of wine.

1141
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:49,450
Did you have a good hunt?

1142
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,790
You know all the girls
around here?

1143
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,790
We saw some real beauties.

1144
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:59,130
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

1145
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:05,100
She would tempt the devil himself.

1146
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:14,900
Really put together.

1147
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,020
Right, Calo?

1148
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:21,780
Such hair, such mouth!

1149
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:27,330
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

1150
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:30,250
This one had a purple dress...

1151
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,750
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

1152
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,790
A type more Greek than Italian.

1153
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:41,050
Do you know her?

1154
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:48,260
There's no girl like that
in this town.

1155
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:52,180
My God, I understand!

1156
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:57,310
What's wrong?

1157
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,900
Let's go.

1158
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,110
It's his daughter.

1159
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,070
Tell him to come here.

1160
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:10,830
Call him.

1161
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:33,220
Fabrizio, you translate.

1162
01:42:37,197 --> 01:42:39,697
I apologize if I offended you.

1163
01:42:40,534 --> 01:42:43,034
I'm a stranger in this country...

1164
01:42:43,537 --> 01:42:46,438
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1165
01:42:52,212 --> 01:42:54,712
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1166
01:42:56,383 --> 01:42:58,883
My name is Michael Corleone.

1167
01:43:00,721 --> 01:43:03,362
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1168
01:43:07,227 --> 01:43:09,727
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1169
01:43:11,665 --> 01:43:14,165
instead of gaining a husband.

1170
01:43:21,909 --> 01:43:24,409
I want to meet your daughter...

1171
01:43:25,245 --> 01:43:27,056
with your permission...

1172
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,580
and under the supervision
of your family...

1173
01:43:30,517 --> 01:43:33,017
with all respect.

1174
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:42,290
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

1175
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,300
What's her name?

1176
01:43:50,704 --> 01:43:53,204
Apollonia.

1177
01:44:47,705 --> 01:44:50,682
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1178
01:44:50,706 --> 01:44:53,706
and this is Michael Corleone.

1179
01:45:09,707 --> 01:45:11,707
Thank you.

1180
01:45:12,308 --> 01:45:14,308
Your welcome.

1181
01:45:24,309 --> 01:45:26,809
What's the problem with your eye.

1182
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:29,810
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1183
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:47,011
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1184
01:46:52,519 --> 01:46:55,019
Save it for the library.

1185
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:00,658
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1186
01:47:18,879 --> 01:47:21,379
What's the matter?

1187
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:25,180
What's the matter?

1188
01:47:26,386 --> 01:47:28,531
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1189
01:47:28,555 --> 01:47:31,956
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1190
01:47:32,059 --> 01:47:33,970
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1191
01:47:33,994 --> 01:47:36,494
I'm sorry.

1192
01:47:40,468 --> 01:47:43,798
Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a
doctor to come and take a look at you.

1193
01:47:44,004 --> 01:47:46,734
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1194
01:47:48,842 --> 01:47:50,987
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1195
01:47:51,011 --> 01:47:53,809
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1196
01:47:56,683 --> 01:47:58,161
All right?

1197
01:47:58,185 --> 01:48:01,279
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1198
01:48:01,388 --> 01:48:03,888
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

1199
01:48:05,058 --> 01:48:07,558
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1200
01:48:13,433 --> 01:48:15,933
Carlo, come here.

1201
01:49:13,026 --> 01:49:15,756
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1202
01:53:11,097 --> 01:53:13,827
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1203
01:53:13,933 --> 01:53:18,233
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1204
01:53:18,338 --> 01:53:20,683
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1205
01:53:20,707 --> 01:53:24,108
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1206
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,358
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1207
01:53:29,382 --> 01:53:32,078
But nobody was hurt.

1208
01:53:32,152 --> 01:53:33,152
Tom...

1209
01:53:33,653 --> 01:53:37,487
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1210
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:39,902
Well, if I accepted that...

1211
01:53:39,926 --> 01:53:43,487
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1212
01:53:43,596 --> 01:53:46,316
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1213
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:49,701
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1214
01:53:49,803 --> 01:53:52,303
Come on. I'm sorry. Come on.

1215
01:54:08,621 --> 01:54:11,121
Hello?

1216
01:54:12,692 --> 01:54:14,437
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1217
01:54:14,461 --> 01:54:16,906
<i>- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>

1218
01:54:16,930 --> 01:54:19,990
<i>Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?</i>

1219
01:54:26,206 --> 01:54:28,706
Bitch.

1220
01:54:29,476 --> 01:54:32,070
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1221
01:54:32,178 --> 01:54:34,156
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1222
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:37,240
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1223
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:39,328
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1224
01:54:39,352 --> 01:54:41,852
Go fuck yourself!

1225
01:54:46,559 --> 01:54:49,059
This little guinea brat.

1226
01:54:53,466 --> 01:54:56,060
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1227
01:54:56,169 --> 01:54:58,669
Break it all!

1228
01:55:01,374 --> 01:55:03,874
That's it. Break it all.

1229
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:11,178
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1230
01:55:11,284 --> 01:55:13,784
Maybe I will. Why not?

1231
01:55:19,459 --> 01:55:21,904
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1232
01:55:21,928 --> 01:55:24,406
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

1233
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:26,930
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1234
01:55:31,337 --> 01:55:33,837
You son of a bitch!

1235
01:55:42,515 --> 01:55:45,609
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1236
01:55:45,718 --> 01:55:48,030
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1237
01:55:48,054 --> 01:55:49,765
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1238
01:55:49,789 --> 01:55:52,268
Kill me! Get up!

1239
01:55:52,292 --> 01:55:53,903
Get out of here!

1240
01:55:53,927 --> 01:55:57,419
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1241
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:59,508
You guinea brat, you.

1242
01:55:59,532 --> 01:56:02,032
Get out here!

1243
01:56:10,877 --> 01:56:13,812
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1244
01:56:14,981 --> 01:56:17,848
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1245
01:56:17,951 --> 01:56:19,962
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1246
01:56:19,986 --> 01:56:22,031
I don't understand.

1247
01:56:22,055 --> 01:56:24,555
Yeah, Connie.

1248
01:56:29,095 --> 01:56:31,595
Listen, you wait there.

1249
01:56:33,466 --> 01:56:35,966
No, you just wait there.

1250
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:40,671
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1251
01:56:40,773 --> 01:56:42,885
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1252
01:56:42,909 --> 01:56:45,409
Damn it!

1253
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,208
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1254
01:57:06,733 --> 01:57:09,566
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1255
01:57:09,669 --> 01:57:12,169
Go after him. Go on.

1256
01:57:40,566 --> 01:57:42,478
Son of a bitch.

1257
01:57:42,502 --> 01:57:45,002
Come on! Come on!

1258
01:59:32,078 --> 01:59:34,578
Give me a drop.

1259
01:59:42,188 --> 01:59:44,688
My wife is crying upstairs.

1260
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:49,359
I hear cars coming to the house.

1261
01:59:53,933 --> 01:59:56,433
Consigliere of mine...

1262
01:59:57,303 --> 02:00:00,238
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1263
02:00:00,339 --> 02:00:02,839
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1264
02:00:04,043 --> 02:00:07,570
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1265
02:00:10,716 --> 02:00:13,216
But you needed a drink first.

1266
02:00:19,792 --> 02:00:22,292
Now you've had your drink.

1267
02:00:27,834 --> 02:00:31,998
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1268
02:00:49,288 --> 02:00:51,788
I want all inquiries made.

1269
02:00:55,962 --> 02:00:58,462
I want no acts of vengeance.

1270
02:00:59,999 --> 02:01:02,499
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1271
02:01:03,803 --> 02:01:06,303
with the heads
of the five families.

1272
02:01:08,541 --> 02:01:11,041
This war stops now.

1273
02:01:32,498 --> 02:01:35,023
Call Bonasera.

1274
02:01:35,134 --> 02:01:37,634
We need him now.

1275
02:01:49,482 --> 02:01:52,451
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1276
02:01:52,552 --> 02:01:54,630
at his request.

1277
02:01:54,654 --> 02:01:56,932
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1278
02:01:56,956 --> 02:02:00,790
<i>He has no doubt that
you will repay it.</i>

1279
02:02:00,893 --> 02:02:03,657
<i>Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.</i>

1280
02:02:03,763 --> 02:02:06,263
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1281
02:02:26,485 --> 02:02:28,797
Well, my friend...

1282
02:02:28,821 --> 02:02:31,266
are you ready
to do me this service?

1283
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:32,935
Yes.

1284
02:02:32,959 --> 02:02:35,484
What do you want me to do?

1285
02:02:42,835 --> 02:02:45,861
I want you to use
all your powers...

1286
02:02:45,972 --> 02:02:48,472
and all your skills.

1287
02:02:51,477 --> 02:02:53,977
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1288
02:03:10,529 --> 02:03:13,029
Look how they massacred my boy.

1289
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:45,750
It's safer to teach you English!

1290
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,876
I know English...

1291
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:49,778
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1292
02:03:49,802 --> 02:03:52,430
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1293
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:01,800
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

1294
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:04,510
How are things in Palermo?

1295
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:14,570
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

1296
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,200
How are things in Palermo?

1297
02:04:19,570 --> 02:04:22,700
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

1298
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:27,160
times are changing for the worse.

1299
02:04:29,410 --> 02:04:32,830
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1300
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:40,720
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

1301
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,890
What's wrong?

1302
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,230
Bad news from America.

1303
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:57,400
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

1304
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:05,830
Let's go... you promised.

1305
02:05:24,617 --> 02:05:25,617
Fabrizio!

1306
02:05:25,641 --> 02:05:25,696
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1307
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:27,140
Get the car.

1308
02:05:28,467 --> 02:05:30,112
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1309
02:05:30,136 --> 02:05:32,414
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1310
02:05:32,438 --> 02:05:35,999
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1311
02:05:36,108 --> 02:05:38,608
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1312
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,030
Calo, where is Apollonia?

1313
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:50,290
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

1314
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:54,620
She'll make a good American wife.

1315
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:58,630
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

1316
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:11,060
Fabrizio!

1317
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:12,810
Where are you going?

1318
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,940
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

1319
02:06:47,646 --> 02:06:49,558
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1320
02:06:49,582 --> 02:06:53,109
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1321
02:06:53,219 --> 02:06:56,586
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1322
02:06:56,689 --> 02:06:59,189
from New York and New Jersey.

1323
02:07:00,192 --> 02:07:03,218
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1324
02:07:05,698 --> 02:07:08,198
From Brooklyn...

1325
02:07:08,367 --> 02:07:10,867
Philip Tattaglia.

1326
02:07:12,271 --> 02:07:15,104
And from Staten Island...

1327
02:07:15,207 --> 02:07:18,472
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1328
02:07:18,577 --> 02:07:21,077
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1329
02:07:21,146 --> 02:07:24,274
as from California
and Kansas City...

1330
02:07:24,383 --> 02:07:26,795
and all the other territories
of the country.

1331
02:07:26,819 --> 02:07:29,319
Thank you.

1332
02:07:34,927 --> 02:07:37,427
How did things ever get so far?

1333
02:07:38,464 --> 02:07:40,964
I don't know.

1334
02:07:42,201 --> 02:07:45,693
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1335
02:07:48,774 --> 02:07:50,986
Tattaglia lost a son...

1336
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:53,510
and I lost a son.

1337
02:07:54,246 --> 02:07:57,841
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1338
02:07:57,950 --> 02:08:02,011
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1339
02:08:03,656 --> 02:08:07,183
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1340
02:08:07,293 --> 02:08:09,989
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1341
02:08:10,095 --> 02:08:12,307
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1342
02:08:12,331 --> 02:08:14,831
Yes, Don Barzini.

1343
02:08:14,867 --> 02:08:16,912
He's too modest.

1344
02:08:16,936 --> 02:08:19,905
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1345
02:08:21,307 --> 02:08:24,140
He refused to share them.

1346
02:08:24,243 --> 02:08:27,235
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1347
02:08:28,113 --> 02:08:30,613
All of you know me here.

1348
02:08:31,483 --> 02:08:35,510
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1349
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:38,121
And why?

1350
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:40,790
Because I believe
this drug business...

1351
02:08:40,893 --> 02:08:44,021
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1352
02:08:44,129 --> 02:08:47,860
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1353
02:08:47,967 --> 02:08:50,697
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1354
02:08:50,803 --> 02:08:54,261
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1355
02:08:54,373 --> 02:08:57,467
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1356
02:08:57,576 --> 02:08:59,387
with gambling and other things...

1357
02:08:59,411 --> 02:09:03,541
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1358
02:09:03,649 --> 02:09:06,584
And I believed that then...

1359
02:09:06,685 --> 02:09:08,797
and I believe that now.

1360
02:09:08,821 --> 02:09:11,099
Times have changed.

1361
02:09:11,123 --> 02:09:13,368
It's not like the old days...

1362
02:09:13,392 --> 02:09:15,892
when we could do
anything we want.

1363
02:09:15,928 --> 02:09:18,829
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1364
02:09:18,931 --> 02:09:22,867
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1365
02:09:22,968 --> 02:09:25,960
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1366
02:09:26,071 --> 02:09:29,234
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1367
02:09:30,175 --> 02:09:33,736
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1368
02:09:33,846 --> 02:09:36,576
After all, we are not Communists.

1369
02:09:39,551 --> 02:09:42,611
I also don't believe in drugs.

1370
02:09:42,721 --> 02:09:44,933
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1371
02:09:44,957 --> 02:09:47,335
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1372
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:50,795
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1373
02:09:50,896 --> 02:09:53,626
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1374
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:57,262
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1375
02:09:58,370 --> 02:10:02,170
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1376
02:10:02,274 --> 02:10:04,719
to keep it respectable.

1377
02:10:04,743 --> 02:10:09,271
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1378
02:10:09,381 --> 02:10:11,881
That's an infamia.

1379
02:10:12,418 --> 02:10:16,354
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1380
02:10:16,455 --> 02:10:19,322
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1381
02:10:26,298 --> 02:10:29,597
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1382
02:10:31,336 --> 02:10:34,499
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1383
02:10:34,606 --> 02:10:38,098
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1384
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:40,355
Then we are agreed.

1385
02:10:40,379 --> 02:10:42,791
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1386
02:10:42,815 --> 02:10:45,375
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1387
02:10:45,484 --> 02:10:47,395
and there will be the peace.

1388
02:10:47,419 --> 02:10:51,287
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1389
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:54,553
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1390
02:10:54,660 --> 02:10:57,185
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1391
02:10:57,296 --> 02:10:59,340
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1392
02:10:59,364 --> 02:11:02,800
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1393
02:11:02,901 --> 02:11:05,113
You talk about vengeance.

1394
02:11:05,137 --> 02:11:08,402
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1395
02:11:08,507 --> 02:11:11,007
Or my boy to me?

1396
02:11:11,677 --> 02:11:14,177
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1397
02:11:17,316 --> 02:11:19,816
But I have selfish reasons.

1398
02:11:21,820 --> 02:11:23,832
My youngest son...

1399
02:11:23,856 --> 02:11:26,356
was forced to leave this country...

1400
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:29,859
because of this Sollozzo business.

1401
02:11:30,329 --> 02:11:33,162
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1402
02:11:33,265 --> 02:11:37,895
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1403
02:11:39,538 --> 02:11:42,564
But I'm a superstitious man.

1404
02:11:42,674 --> 02:11:45,234
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1405
02:11:45,344 --> 02:11:49,075
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1406
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:53,015
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1407
02:11:53,118 --> 02:11:55,618
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1408
02:11:57,256 --> 02:12:00,282
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1409
02:12:02,494 --> 02:12:04,994
And that I do not forgive.

1410
02:12:07,332 --> 02:12:09,832
But that aside...

1411
02:12:12,771 --> 02:12:15,271
let me say that I swear...

1412
02:12:16,708 --> 02:12:19,802
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1413
02:12:19,912 --> 02:12:23,439
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1414
02:12:49,841 --> 02:12:52,081
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1415
02:12:52,105 --> 02:12:55,210
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1416
02:12:55,314 --> 02:12:57,814
Mention it. Don't insist.

1417
02:12:59,651 --> 02:13:02,151
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1418
02:13:03,488 --> 02:13:06,082
You mean Tattaglia.

1419
02:13:06,191 --> 02:13:08,921
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1420
02:13:09,027 --> 02:13:11,527
He never could've outfought Santino.

1421
02:13:14,866 --> 02:13:18,529
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1422
02:13:18,637 --> 02:13:21,137
Barzini all along.

1423
02:13:35,787 --> 02:13:38,287
Come on, Nancy.

1424
02:13:38,991 --> 02:13:41,491
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1425
02:13:42,861 --> 02:13:45,361
Okay. All right.

1426
02:13:57,909 --> 02:14:00,434
How long have you been back?

1427
02:14:00,545 --> 02:14:03,045
I've been back a year.

1428
02:14:03,982 --> 02:14:06,507
Longer than that, I think.

1429
02:14:08,754 --> 02:14:11,254
It's good to see you, Kay.

1430
02:14:17,162 --> 02:14:19,662
Hi, Miss Adams!

1431
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,500
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1432
02:14:27,139 --> 02:14:29,150
He's been sick.

1433
02:14:29,174 --> 02:14:31,586
Very sick.

1434
02:14:31,610 --> 02:14:33,688
But you're not like him, Michael.

1435
02:14:33,712 --> 02:14:36,237
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1436
02:14:36,348 --> 02:14:38,848
That's what you told me.

1437
02:14:39,384 --> 02:14:42,114
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1438
02:14:43,789 --> 02:14:47,350
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1439
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:50,938
Like a senator or a president.

1440
02:14:50,962 --> 02:14:53,487
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1441
02:14:53,598 --> 02:14:56,192
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1442
02:14:57,537 --> 02:14:58,537
Oh.

1443
02:14:59,538 --> 02:15:02,038
Who's being naive, Kay?

1444
02:15:02,674 --> 02:15:04,886
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1445
02:15:04,910 --> 02:15:08,402
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1446
02:15:08,513 --> 02:15:10,525
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1447
02:15:10,549 --> 02:15:13,049
is going to be completely legitimate.

1448
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:17,664
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1449
02:15:17,688 --> 02:15:18,688
Kay.

1450
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:22,503
Michael, why did you come here?

1451
02:15:22,527 --> 02:15:24,706
Why?

1452
02:15:24,730 --> 02:15:26,774
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1453
02:15:26,798 --> 02:15:29,323
without even calling or writing?

1454
02:15:29,434 --> 02:15:31,412
I came here because I need you.

1455
02:15:31,436 --> 02:15:33,961
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1456
02:15:34,072 --> 02:15:37,200
Because I want you to marry me.

1457
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:41,210
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1458
02:15:42,914 --> 02:15:46,782
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1459
02:15:48,587 --> 02:15:50,898
Because that's important, Kay.

1460
02:15:50,922 --> 02:15:54,414
Because what's important is that...

1461
02:15:54,526 --> 02:15:56,337
we have each other.

1462
02:15:56,361 --> 02:15:59,262
That we have a life together.

1463
02:15:59,364 --> 02:16:02,822
That we have children.
Our children.

1464
02:16:03,323 --> 02:16:04,323
Kay...

1465
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:07,700
I need you...

1466
02:16:07,806 --> 02:16:10,306
and I love you.

1467
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:33,408
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1468
02:16:33,432 --> 02:16:35,276
and we do nothing about it.

1469
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:37,981
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1470
02:16:38,036 --> 02:16:40,561
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1471
02:16:40,672 --> 02:16:43,197
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1472
02:16:43,308 --> 02:16:45,420
We gotta protect ourselves.

1473
02:16:45,444 --> 02:16:47,422
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1474
02:16:47,446 --> 02:16:49,056
No.

1475
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:51,580
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1476
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:54,175
Mike, you're wrong.

1477
02:16:54,286 --> 02:16:57,915
Don Corleone, you once said that the day would come...

1478
02:16:58,023 --> 02:17:00,719
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1479
02:17:00,826 --> 02:17:02,804
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1480
02:17:02,828 --> 02:17:05,173
I must ask your permission.

1481
02:17:05,197 --> 02:17:08,428
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1482
02:17:08,533 --> 02:17:11,229
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1483
02:17:12,804 --> 02:17:15,304
After we make the move to Nevada...

1484
02:17:15,407 --> 02:17:18,399
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1485
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:21,308
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1486
02:17:22,547 --> 02:17:24,158
Six months.

1487
02:17:24,182 --> 02:17:27,640
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1488
02:17:27,752 --> 02:17:30,721
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1489
02:17:30,822 --> 02:17:33,322
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1490
02:17:33,358 --> 02:17:36,293
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1491
02:17:36,394 --> 02:17:39,386
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1492
02:17:39,498 --> 02:17:42,296
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1493
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,645
Then be a friend to Michael...

1494
02:17:44,669 --> 02:17:47,169
and do as he says.

1495
02:17:50,609 --> 02:17:53,129
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1496
02:17:53,153 --> 02:17:55,905
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1497
02:17:56,014 --> 02:17:58,514
That's all I can tell you now.

1498
02:17:59,017 --> 02:18:01,645
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1499
02:18:01,753 --> 02:18:04,916
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1500
02:18:05,023 --> 02:18:07,719
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1501
02:18:07,826 --> 02:18:10,304
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1502
02:18:10,328 --> 02:18:12,773
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1503
02:18:12,797 --> 02:18:14,709
Besides, if I ever need help...

1504
02:18:14,733 --> 02:18:17,011
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1505
02:18:17,035 --> 02:18:19,535
Now that's it.

1506
02:18:37,622 --> 02:18:40,122
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1507
02:18:41,528 --> 02:18:45,758
Mike, ehh... Why am I out?

1508
02:18:45,864 --> 02:18:48,364
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1509
02:18:49,935 --> 02:18:52,435
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1510
02:18:53,136 --> 02:18:54,136
Tom...

1511
02:18:59,711 --> 02:19:01,956
I advised Michael.

1512
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:04,881
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1513
02:19:04,983 --> 02:19:08,248
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1514
02:19:08,353 --> 02:19:10,598
rest in peace.

1515
02:19:10,622 --> 02:19:13,648
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1516
02:19:14,859 --> 02:19:18,386
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1517
02:19:18,496 --> 02:19:20,708
in what is going to happen.

1518
02:19:20,732 --> 02:19:22,209
Maybe I could help.

1519
02:19:22,233 --> 02:19:24,733
You're out, Tom.

1520
02:20:13,151 --> 02:20:15,676
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1521
02:20:15,787 --> 02:20:18,950
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1522
02:20:19,057 --> 02:20:21,685
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1523
02:20:21,793 --> 02:20:24,171
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1524
02:20:24,195 --> 02:20:26,173
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1525
02:20:26,197 --> 02:20:29,257
For right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1526
02:20:34,806 --> 02:20:37,118
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1527
02:20:37,142 --> 02:20:40,407
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1528
02:20:40,512 --> 02:20:43,310
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1529
02:20:47,052 --> 02:20:49,850
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1530
02:20:49,954 --> 02:20:52,889
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1531
02:20:52,991 --> 02:20:55,491
Who are the girls?

1532
02:20:56,061 --> 02:20:58,039
That's for you to find out.

1533
02:20:58,063 --> 02:21:00,930
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1534
02:21:01,032 --> 02:21:03,144
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1535
02:21:03,168 --> 02:21:06,899
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1536
02:21:07,005 --> 02:21:09,505
Get rid of the band too.

1537
02:21:14,479 --> 02:21:17,277
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1538
02:21:17,382 --> 02:21:20,647
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1539
02:21:20,752 --> 02:21:22,763
Let's go. Hey, come on!

1540
02:21:22,787 --> 02:21:25,287
Scram!

1541
02:21:25,557 --> 02:21:27,902
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1542
02:21:27,926 --> 02:21:30,286
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1543
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:32,373
It's all right, Freddy.

1544
02:21:32,397 --> 02:21:34,897
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1545
02:21:41,906 --> 02:21:44,406
What happened to Moe Greene?

1546
02:21:45,009 --> 02:21:47,488
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1547
02:21:47,512 --> 02:21:49,457
when the party started.

1548
02:21:49,481 --> 02:21:51,981
Well, give him a call.

1549
02:21:52,784 --> 02:21:55,878
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1550
02:21:55,987 --> 02:21:58,132
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1551
02:21:58,156 --> 02:22:00,534
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1552
02:22:00,558 --> 02:22:04,995
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1553
02:22:05,096 --> 02:22:07,108
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1554
02:22:07,132 --> 02:22:10,192
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1555
02:22:10,301 --> 02:22:12,801
Mike, what can I do?

1556
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:16,150
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1557
02:22:16,174 --> 02:22:19,575
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1558
02:22:19,677 --> 02:22:22,942
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1559
02:22:23,047 --> 02:22:25,641
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1560
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:28,028
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1561
02:22:28,052 --> 02:22:30,919
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1562
02:22:31,022 --> 02:22:33,522
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1563
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,671
See, Johnny...

1564
02:22:37,695 --> 02:22:39,974
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1565
02:22:39,998 --> 02:22:41,776
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1566
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:45,099
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1567
02:22:48,606 --> 02:22:51,871
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1568
02:22:51,976 --> 02:22:54,476
to do the same.

1569
02:22:54,546 --> 02:22:57,046
We're counting on you.

1570
02:22:58,650 --> 02:23:01,175
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1571
02:23:01,286 --> 02:23:02,596
You know that.

1572
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:05,120
Good.

1573
02:23:05,256 --> 02:23:07,468
Hey, Mike. Hello, fellas.

1574
02:23:07,492 --> 02:23:11,189
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1575
02:23:11,296 --> 02:23:13,307
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1576
02:23:13,331 --> 02:23:16,211
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1577
02:23:16,235 --> 02:23:17,878
and your credit is good.

1578
02:23:17,902 --> 02:23:20,543
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1579
02:23:24,108 --> 02:23:26,608
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1580
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:30,491
Buy me out?

1581
02:23:30,515 --> 02:23:33,177
The casino. The hotel.

1582
02:23:33,284 --> 02:23:36,048
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1583
02:23:36,154 --> 02:23:39,021
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1584
02:23:39,123 --> 02:23:41,623
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1585
02:23:41,659 --> 02:23:44,924
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1586
02:23:45,029 --> 02:23:47,529
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1587
02:23:48,333 --> 02:23:50,833
You're unlucky.

1588
02:23:54,005 --> 02:23:56,450
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1589
02:23:56,474 --> 02:23:59,307
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1590
02:23:59,410 --> 02:24:01,856
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1591
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:04,474
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1592
02:24:04,582 --> 02:24:07,082
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1593
02:24:07,185 --> 02:24:09,296
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1594
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:11,365
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1595
02:24:11,389 --> 02:24:14,119
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1596
02:24:14,202 --> 02:24:16,722
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1597
02:24:16,746 --> 02:24:19,466
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1598
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:21,008
by Barzini and the other families.

1599
02:24:21,032 --> 02:24:24,934
What do you think is going on here? You
think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1600
02:24:25,036 --> 02:24:26,847
I talked to Barzini.

1601
02:24:26,871 --> 02:24:30,136
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1602
02:24:30,241 --> 02:24:32,835
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1603
02:24:33,912 --> 02:24:35,613
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1604
02:24:35,914 --> 02:24:38,474
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1605
02:24:38,583 --> 02:24:41,061
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1606
02:24:41,085 --> 02:24:43,197
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1607
02:24:43,221 --> 02:24:45,065
I got a business to run.

1608
02:24:45,089 --> 02:24:47,819
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1609
02:24:47,926 --> 02:24:51,919
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1610
02:24:52,030 --> 02:24:54,624
You straightened my brother out?

1611
02:24:54,732 --> 02:24:57,211
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1612
02:24:57,235 --> 02:25:00,136
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1613
02:25:06,177 --> 02:25:09,669
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1614
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:11,458
Son of a bitch.

1615
02:25:11,482 --> 02:25:14,508
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1616
02:25:14,619 --> 02:25:17,213
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1617
02:25:17,322 --> 02:25:19,822
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1618
02:25:20,825 --> 02:25:24,022
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1619
02:25:24,128 --> 02:25:26,106
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1620
02:25:26,130 --> 02:25:29,725
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1621
02:25:29,834 --> 02:25:32,394
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1622
02:25:37,276 --> 02:25:41,871
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1623
02:25:44,217 --> 02:25:48,947
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1624
02:25:50,455 --> 02:25:52,499
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1625
02:25:52,523 --> 02:25:55,424
against the family again...

1626
02:25:55,526 --> 02:25:58,026
ever.

1627
02:26:04,836 --> 02:26:06,981
I have to see my father
and his people.

1628
02:26:07,005 --> 02:26:09,505
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1629
02:26:11,009 --> 02:26:13,253
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1630
02:26:13,277 --> 02:26:15,777
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1631
02:26:23,221 --> 02:26:26,122
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1632
02:26:26,224 --> 02:26:28,335
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1633
02:26:28,359 --> 02:26:31,590
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1634
02:26:31,696 --> 02:26:33,540
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1635
02:26:33,564 --> 02:26:36,064
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1636
02:26:42,673 --> 02:26:44,585
So...

1637
02:26:44,609 --> 02:26:47,578
Barzini will move against you first.

1638
02:26:47,678 --> 02:26:52,012
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1639
02:26:52,116 --> 02:26:54,616
guaranteeing your safety.

1640
02:26:55,453 --> 02:26:58,718
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1641
02:27:03,361 --> 02:27:06,558
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1642
02:27:07,732 --> 02:27:09,877
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1643
02:27:09,901 --> 02:27:12,401
It's good for you, Pop.

1644
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:18,840
I don't know.

1645
02:27:19,744 --> 02:27:22,244
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1646
02:27:23,648 --> 02:27:25,692
Very happy.

1647
02:27:25,716 --> 02:27:28,241
That's good.

1648
02:27:28,352 --> 02:27:30,597
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1649
02:27:30,621 --> 02:27:33,215
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1650
02:27:33,324 --> 02:27:35,369
No, not at all.

1651
02:27:35,393 --> 02:27:37,738
It's an old habit.

1652
02:27:37,762 --> 02:27:40,526
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1653
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:45,233
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1654
02:27:49,107 --> 02:27:51,667
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1655
02:27:51,776 --> 02:27:54,276
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1656
02:27:57,081 --> 02:27:59,326
He's smarter than I am.

1657
02:27:59,350 --> 02:28:01,850
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1658
02:28:03,654 --> 02:28:06,154
Reads the funny papers.

1659
02:28:12,897 --> 02:28:15,375
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1660
02:28:15,399 --> 02:28:18,527
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1661
02:28:18,636 --> 02:28:20,747
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1662
02:28:20,771 --> 02:28:24,298
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1663
02:28:28,012 --> 02:28:30,390
What's the matter?

1664
02:28:30,414 --> 02:28:32,914
What's bothering you?

1665
02:28:35,686 --> 02:28:38,186
I'll handle it.

1666
02:28:38,589 --> 02:28:41,089
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1667
02:28:54,138 --> 02:28:58,472
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1668
02:28:58,576 --> 02:29:00,454
and Fredo...

1669
02:29:00,478 --> 02:29:02,923
Well...

1670
02:29:02,947 --> 02:29:05,447
Fredo was...

1671
02:29:06,984 --> 02:29:09,748
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1672
02:29:12,023 --> 02:29:14,856
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1673
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:17,104
to take care of my family...

1674
02:29:17,128 --> 02:29:20,996
and I refused to be a fool...

1675
02:29:21,098 --> 02:29:25,159
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1676
02:29:27,271 --> 02:29:30,434
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1677
02:29:32,410 --> 02:29:35,004
that when it was your time...

1678
02:29:35,112 --> 02:29:37,612
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1679
02:29:39,450 --> 02:29:41,950
Senator Corleone.

1680
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:45,065
Governor Corleone. Something.

1681
02:29:45,089 --> 02:29:47,589
Another pezzonovante.

1682
02:29:53,097 --> 02:29:56,931
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1683
02:29:57,034 --> 02:29:59,628
We'll get there, Pop.

1684
02:29:59,737 --> 02:30:02,237
We'll get there.

1685
02:30:05,476 --> 02:30:09,845
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1686
02:30:09,947 --> 02:30:11,692
he's the traitor.

1687
02:30:11,716 --> 02:30:14,216
Don't forget that.

1688
02:30:29,967 --> 02:30:32,467
Put it over the tree.

1689
02:30:47,251 --> 02:30:49,696
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1690
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:51,265
That's fine.

1691
02:30:51,289 --> 02:30:53,789
Over here. Over here.

1692
02:30:55,893 --> 02:30:58,393
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1693
02:31:04,702 --> 02:31:07,202
Anthony, come here.

1694
02:31:12,610 --> 02:31:15,110
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1695
02:31:20,918 --> 02:31:23,418
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1696
02:31:25,923 --> 02:31:28,423
Now, you stand there.

1697
02:31:31,529 --> 02:31:34,029
Give me an orange!

1698
02:31:51,615 --> 02:31:54,115
That's a new trick.

1699
02:31:54,685 --> 02:31:57,245
You run in there. Run in there.

1700
02:32:09,867 --> 02:32:12,367
- Where are you?
- Who?

1701
02:32:45,503 --> 02:32:48,003
Ouch!

1702
02:35:09,547 --> 02:35:12,047
Mike, can I have a minute?

1703
02:35:22,393 --> 02:35:24,838
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1704
02:35:24,862 --> 02:35:27,362
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1705
02:35:29,033 --> 02:35:31,533
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1706
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:34,881
I can arrange security...

1707
02:35:34,905 --> 02:35:37,405
on my territory.

1708
02:35:39,343 --> 02:35:41,321
All right?

1709
02:35:41,345 --> 02:35:44,178
- All right.
- All right.

1710
02:35:59,463 --> 02:36:01,963
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1711
02:36:04,902 --> 02:36:07,314
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1712
02:36:07,338 --> 02:36:09,838
Tessio's ground...

1713
02:36:10,708 --> 02:36:13,208
where I'll be safe.

1714
02:36:24,755 --> 02:36:28,350
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1715
02:36:28,459 --> 02:36:30,804
It's the smart move.

1716
02:36:30,828 --> 02:36:33,328
Tessio was always smarter.

1717
02:36:34,531 --> 02:36:36,810
But I'm gonna wait.

1718
02:36:36,834 --> 02:36:39,334
After the baptism.

1719
02:36:41,305 --> 02:36:43,865
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1720
02:36:45,209 --> 02:36:48,144
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1721
02:36:48,245 --> 02:36:50,690
and Tattaglia...

1722
02:36:50,714 --> 02:36:53,214
all the heads
of the five families.

1723
02:37:19,715 --> 02:37:21,715
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1724
02:37:21,916 --> 02:37:25,116
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1725
02:37:27,094 --> 02:37:28,094
Let us pray.

1726
02:37:28,118 --> 02:37:31,118
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1727
02:37:31,696 --> 02:37:32,696
Michael.

1728
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:35,720
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1729
02:37:36,721 --> 02:37:39,698
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1730
02:37:39,722 --> 02:37:42,699
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1731
02:37:42,723 --> 02:37:45,700
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1732
02:37:45,724 --> 02:37:48,701
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1733
02:37:48,725 --> 02:37:51,702
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1734
02:37:51,726 --> 02:37:54,203
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1735
02:37:54,227 --> 02:37:57,204
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1736
02:37:57,228 --> 02:38:00,205
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1737
02:38:00,229 --> 02:38:03,206
and the world by fire. So be it.

1738
02:38:03,230 --> 02:38:05,507
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1739
02:38:05,531 --> 02:38:07,808
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1740
02:38:07,832 --> 02:38:09,872
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1741
02:38:09,896 --> 02:38:12,310
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1742
02:38:12,334 --> 02:38:14,834
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1743
02:38:15,835 --> 02:38:18,335
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1744
02:38:18,836 --> 02:38:22,313
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1745
02:38:22,337 --> 02:38:25,337
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1746
02:38:26,338 --> 02:38:29,638
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1747
02:38:29,939 --> 02:38:32,939
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1748
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:43,317
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1749
02:38:43,341 --> 02:38:46,318
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1750
02:38:46,342 --> 02:38:49,842
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1751
02:38:50,843 --> 02:38:53,820
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1752
02:38:53,844 --> 02:38:56,821
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1753
02:38:56,845 --> 02:39:00,822
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1754
02:39:00,846 --> 02:39:04,346
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1755
02:39:06,147 --> 02:39:09,124
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1756
02:39:09,148 --> 02:39:12,125
Be thou, devil, begone,

1757
02:39:12,149 --> 02:39:14,449
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1758
02:39:14,491 --> 02:39:17,392
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1759
02:39:17,494 --> 02:39:20,463
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1760
02:39:20,564 --> 02:39:23,863
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord?</i>

1761
02:39:23,967 --> 02:39:25,445
<i>I do.</i>

1762
02:39:25,469 --> 02:39:29,616
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1763
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:30,640
<i>I do.</i>

1764
02:39:30,941 --> 02:39:34,818
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1765
02:39:34,842 --> 02:39:38,819
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1766
02:39:38,843 --> 02:39:41,620
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1767
02:39:41,644 --> 02:39:43,644
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1768
02:39:43,845 --> 02:39:46,915
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1769
02:39:46,939 --> 02:39:49,916
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1770
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:51,917
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1771
02:39:51,941 --> 02:39:53,418
Michael.

1772
02:39:53,442 --> 02:39:56,419
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1773
02:39:56,443 --> 02:39:59,420
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1774
02:39:59,444 --> 02:40:01,921
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1775
02:40:01,945 --> 02:40:03,922
Creator of heaven and earth,

1776
02:40:03,946 --> 02:40:07,423
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1777
02:40:07,447 --> 02:40:09,724
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1778
02:40:09,748 --> 02:40:11,725
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1779
02:40:11,749 --> 02:40:15,027
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1780
02:40:15,051 --> 02:40:17,728
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1781
02:40:17,752 --> 02:40:21,729
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1782
02:40:21,753 --> 02:40:24,530
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1783
02:40:24,554 --> 02:40:27,031
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1784
02:40:27,055 --> 02:40:30,032
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1785
02:40:30,056 --> 02:40:33,033
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1786
02:40:33,057 --> 02:40:35,857
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1787
02:40:35,939 --> 02:40:40,876
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1788
02:40:47,284 --> 02:40:49,784
I do renounce him.

1789
02:40:58,095 --> 02:41:00,595
And all his works?

1790
02:41:12,809 --> 02:41:15,309
I do renounce them.

1791
02:41:20,183 --> 02:41:24,142
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1792
02:41:39,536 --> 02:41:43,597
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1793
02:41:43,707 --> 02:41:45,684
I will.

1794
02:41:45,708 --> 02:41:47,985
In the name of the Father,

1795
02:41:48,009 --> 02:41:49,986
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1796
02:41:50,010 --> 02:41:52,410
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1797
02:41:52,749 --> 02:41:55,309
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1798
02:41:55,419 --> 02:41:58,445
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1799
02:42:40,564 --> 02:42:42,542
- Carlo.
- What?

1800
02:42:42,566 --> 02:42:44,777
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1801
02:42:44,801 --> 02:42:46,813
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1802
02:42:46,837 --> 02:42:49,397
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1803
02:42:49,506 --> 02:42:51,484
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1804
02:42:51,508 --> 02:42:54,375
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1805
02:42:54,478 --> 02:42:56,978
I'll only be a couple of days.

1806
02:42:59,416 --> 02:43:01,916
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1807
02:43:12,929 --> 02:43:15,429
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1808
02:43:17,267 --> 02:43:19,645
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1809
02:43:19,669 --> 02:43:22,169
I'm sure he will.

1810
02:43:28,912 --> 02:43:31,938
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1811
02:43:32,049 --> 02:43:34,227
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1812
02:43:34,251 --> 02:43:36,879
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1813
02:43:36,987 --> 02:43:39,487
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1814
02:43:52,102 --> 02:43:54,866
Tell Mike it was only business.

1815
02:43:54,971 --> 02:43:57,471
I always liked him.

1816
02:43:57,641 --> 02:44:00,141
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1817
02:44:06,550 --> 02:44:09,050
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1818
02:44:10,153 --> 02:44:12,849
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1819
02:44:58,802 --> 02:45:01,302
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1820
02:45:06,209 --> 02:45:08,020
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1821
02:45:08,044 --> 02:45:10,544
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1822
02:45:12,149 --> 02:45:15,209
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1823
02:45:15,318 --> 02:45:17,296
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1824
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:20,483
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1825
02:45:20,590 --> 02:45:23,090
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1826
02:45:26,229 --> 02:45:28,729
Don't do this to me, please.

1827
02:45:37,607 --> 02:45:40,107
Barzini's dead.

1828
02:45:41,278 --> 02:45:43,778
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1829
02:45:44,981 --> 02:45:47,460
Moe Greene...

1830
02:45:47,484 --> 02:45:49,984
Stracci...

1831
02:45:50,554 --> 02:45:53,054
Cuneo.

1832
02:45:53,123 --> 02:45:56,615
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1833
02:45:58,495 --> 02:46:00,995
Admit what you did.

1834
02:46:04,134 --> 02:46:06,634
Get him a drink.

1835
02:46:12,275 --> 02:46:14,687
Come on.

1836
02:46:14,711 --> 02:46:17,089
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1837
02:46:17,113 --> 02:46:19,613
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1838
02:46:21,251 --> 02:46:23,751
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1839
02:46:30,894 --> 02:46:32,205
Go ahead, drink.

1840
02:46:32,229 --> 02:46:34,729
Drink.

1841
02:46:37,801 --> 02:46:39,946
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1842
02:46:39,970 --> 02:46:43,633
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1843
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:46,240
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1844
02:46:52,482 --> 02:46:55,883
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1845
02:46:55,986 --> 02:46:58,486
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1846
02:47:00,056 --> 02:47:03,025
because it insults my intelligence.

1847
02:47:03,126 --> 02:47:05,626
It makes me very angry.

1848
02:47:08,531 --> 02:47:11,762
Now, who approached you?

1849
02:47:11,868 --> 02:47:14,368
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1850
02:47:21,511 --> 02:47:24,011
It was Barzini.

1851
02:47:26,449 --> 02:47:28,949
Good.

1852
02:47:35,592 --> 02:47:38,254
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1853
02:47:39,696 --> 02:47:42,196
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1854
02:47:47,804 --> 02:47:50,304
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1855
02:48:15,765 --> 02:48:18,265
Hello, Carlo.

1856
02:49:14,791 --> 02:49:17,589
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1857
02:49:17,694 --> 02:49:20,492
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1858
02:49:28,907 --> 02:49:30,907
Michael! Michael!

1859
02:49:31,408 --> 02:49:33,908
Where is he?

1860
02:49:35,812 --> 02:49:40,840
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1861
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:43,544
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1862
02:49:43,653 --> 02:49:45,164
and then you killed him!

1863
02:49:45,188 --> 02:49:48,316
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1864
02:49:48,425 --> 02:49:52,054
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1865
02:49:52,162 --> 02:49:54,662
Now what am I gonna do?

1866
02:49:58,368 --> 02:50:00,868
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1867
02:50:00,937 --> 02:50:03,497
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1868
02:50:03,606 --> 02:50:06,700
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1869
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:09,121
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1870
02:50:09,145 --> 02:50:11,645
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1871
02:50:11,681 --> 02:50:13,426
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1872
02:50:13,450 --> 02:50:15,950
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1873
02:50:29,532 --> 02:50:32,032
Take her upstairs.

1874
02:50:32,068 --> 02:50:34,568
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1875
02:50:54,624 --> 02:50:57,124
She's hysterical.

1876
02:51:01,064 --> 02:51:03,564
Hysterical.

1877
02:51:04,567 --> 02:51:07,067
Michael, is it true?

1878
02:51:08,505 --> 02:51:10,549
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1879
02:51:10,573 --> 02:51:14,065
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1880
02:51:14,177 --> 02:51:16,677
- No.
- Enough!

1881
02:51:35,064 --> 02:51:37,564
All right.

1882
02:51:39,369 --> 02:51:41,869
This one time.

1883
02:51:45,074 --> 02:51:47,574
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1884
02:51:54,117 --> 02:51:56,617
Is it true?

1885
02:52:00,223 --> 02:52:02,723
Is it?

1886
02:52:03,024 --> 02:52:04,524
No.

1887
02:52:18,241 --> 02:52:20,619
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1888
02:52:20,643 --> 02:52:23,143
Come on.

1889
02:52:52,709 --> 02:52:55,209
Don Corleone.
